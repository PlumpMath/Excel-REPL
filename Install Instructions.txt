MANUAL INSTALLATION

If you lack administrator privileges for the automatic installer, you can still install Excel-REPL manually.  Copy these files into

C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns

where USER is your home folder.

Next open Microsoft Excel and select Options, AddIns.  Add Excel-REPL and it will auto-load every time in the future.
